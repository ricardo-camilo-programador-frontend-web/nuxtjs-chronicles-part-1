- Use Tailwind CSS utilities for styling; prefer DaisyUI components for pre-built patterns.
- Minimize custom CSS; leverage Tailwind's `@apply` directive only when abstracting repeated utility combinations.
- Avoid BEM and custom naming; use Tailwind's class names as the design language.
- Keep scoped styles minimal; use Tailwind for responsive and state-driven design.
